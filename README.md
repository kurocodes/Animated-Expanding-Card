## Expanding Card with Framer Motion

Cards that don’t just sit there like boring rectangles—they expand, animate, and show off when you click them ✨
This component is built with React + Framer Motion, and it’s perfect for when you want your UI to feel a little more alive (and a lot more stylish 💅).

The card starts compact, but once clicked, it unfolds smoothly to reveal hidden details, with animated images and text sliding in gracefully.
