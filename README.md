## Expanding Card with Framer Motion

This project demonstrates an animated expanding card component built using React and Framer Motion. The card starts in a compact state and expands smoothly on click, revealing additional details with subtle text and image animations. It makes use of the layout prop from Framer Motion for elegant resizing transitions and AnimatePresence for mounting/unmounting animated elements.

### The design features:

- Smooth layout animations for resizing and reflow
- Animated image scaling based on card state
- Text reveal with staggered fade & slide animations
- Clean Tailwind CSS styling for responsiveness

This example can be used as a base for profile cards, product showcases, or interactive UI elements where content expands dynamically.
